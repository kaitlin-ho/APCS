Activity 1
1a. public static double sentimentVal( String word )
1b. A string parameter is required. It won't work if another parameter is passed.
1c. The method returns a double.

2.  System.out.println(sentimentVal("train"));    0.03
    System.out.println(sentimentVal("crash"));    -2.05
    System.out.println(sentimentVal("phone"));    0.19

3a. It would compile because the return type and parameters match.
3b. It would not compile because the return type and parameters don't match.
3c. It would not compile because the method only takes one String as the parameter.

Activity 2

2) [Review.java]
3) [Review.java]
4) totalSentiment works by using the existing textToString method to create a string version
   of the input file. Then, the string is split into words and assigned to a String Array.
   Each element (in this case, word) in the array is inputted as the parameter to sentimentVal
   and the resulting value is added to the double variable, total, which keeps track of the
   total sentimentVal. After the forloop iteration is finished, the total is returned.
