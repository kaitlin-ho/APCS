Activity 1
1)
  a) public static double sentimentVal( String word )
  b) A string parameter is required. It won't work if another parameter is passed.
  c)The method returns a double.
2)
   System.out.println(sentimentVal("train"));    0.03
   System.out.println(sentimentVal("crash"));    -2.05
   System.out.println(sentimentVal("phone"));    0.19
3)
  a) It would compile because the return type and parameters match.
  b) It would not compile because the return type and parameters don't match.
  c) It would not compile because the method only takes one String as the parameter.

4) totalSentiment works by using the existing textToString method to create a string version
   of the input file. Then, the string is split into words and assigned to a String Array.
   Each element (in this case, word) in the array is inputted as the parameter to sentimentVal
   and the resulting value is added to the double variable, total, which keeps track of the
   total sentimentVal. After the forloop iteration is finished, the total is returned.
5)
  a) The ratings make sense because the stars are proportional to the value of totalSentiment.
     Any negative value of totalSentiment corresponds to 0 stars; any value greater than 9
     corresponds to 5 stars.
  b) totalSentiment can be adjusted
6) The logical error in the student's code is that every value of totalSentiment less than 15
   is counted as 4 stars, since there is no lower bound for the if statement. To fix this, the
   student would need to create bounds in his if statements. For example:
      if (totalSentiment < 15 && totalSentiment > 9) {}
      else if (totalSentiment < 10 && totalSentiment > 4) {}
   With the lower and upper bounds added to the if statements, each value of totalSentiment falls
   into its correct range and the function will return the correct starRating.

3) Describe the action of the indexOf and substring methods. Explain how these methods can be
used to divide an existing string into two parts. Why is it necessary to add 1 to the position
of the space when copying the remainder of the string

   str.indexOf(x) finds where the first occurence of x is in the specified string str. If x is a word,
   it will return the index of the first character. The subtring method
