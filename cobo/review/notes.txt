    totalSentiment works by using the existing textToString method to create a string version
      of the input file. Then, the string is split into words and assigned to a String Array.
      Each element (in this case, word) in the array is inputted as the parameter to sentimentVal
      and the resulting value is added to the double variable, total, which keeps track of the
      total sentimentVal. After the forloop iteration is finished, the total is returned.
