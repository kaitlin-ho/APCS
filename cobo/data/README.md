# Greyducks (Hugo Jenkins, Kaitlin Ho, Ariella Katz)
* APCS pd6
* L08: America's Next Top Data Scientist
* 2022-04-05
* time spent: 4 hrs

## Activity 1
* 1) Piazza, stuycs.org, Google Classroom
* 2) IP address, device type and carrier name
* 3) Delimited means having fixed boundaries as limits. This is necessary when talking about data files because in order to process data, it needs to be separated.
* 4) By looking at the first couple pieces of data in the file
* 5) Astrophysics, running
* 6) What is a black hole? How do athletes perform in school?
* 7) kaggle.com, athletes(as search)
* 8) 57 and 107. Larger data sets reduce the impact of outliers
* 9) Example: Life360 didn't collect user locations, it wouldn't work
* 10) No, but maybe from surveys.
* 11) Yes; what do we have to hide?

## Activity 2
* 1) Brand
* 2) N/A
* 3) public class Cereal
* 4) 15
* 5) String, int, double
     name, type, calories, protein, fat, sodium, fiber, carbs, sugar, potassium, vitamins, shelf, weight, cups, rating
* 6) We did dis code.
* 7) We did dis 2.
* 8) What cereal has the highest rating?
* 9) How do you calculate the rating?
* 10) Do maths.

## Activity 3
* 1) Atlanta, Hartsfield - Jackson Atlanta International Airport, GA, 63.0F
* 2) KNYC
     New York City, Central Park, NY, 49.0F
* 3) Did dis.
* 4) 48
* 5) By name
* 6) NSTU: Pago Pago, AS, Samoa
* 7) What is the farthest west weather station
* 8) Not a lot...

## Activity 4
* 1) What country is the most generous and in what year?
* 2) The data set we chose has 11 value that describes a country's situtation, including the name, year, freedom, and generosity. We found the data set on our teammate's files. 
* 3) We based the Activity 4 project off of the weather one in Activity 3. The algorithm that we came up with was to use a scanner and a constructor that would create instances of Myky containing all information in each row the csv file.
* 4) The class we created has instance variables corresponding to the values for each country in the csv file. It also has an accesor method that provides us the value of generosity for each country, which is what we are comparing to answer the question. We process the csv data in the main method.
* 5) We process our data in the main method, which consists of a scanner to feed each row of the csv file into a constructor. This is possible because we split the String obtained from the scanner and created an ArrayList with the values. The index of the generosity value in the ArrayList, 7, allows us to compare the generosity values of each instance (row/country) and print the country and year of the row with the largest generosity value.
