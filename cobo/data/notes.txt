DISCO
We discovered that you can have java Class < csvFile (you can read a csv file
right into a Scanner)

QCC
How do we fix the problem with the bad data and splitting at commas???

<TNPG>'s CSV FLOW:
<insert your description of your tools and workflow in creating, editing CSV files>
Used Hugo's file of world happiness that he randomly had on his computer.
It is missing data in some places so it wouldn't split at the commas correctly,
since there was no space between the commas in these places.
*The file does not run but it would if Hugo's data wasn't faulty (and we did not
have time to restart with a new csv)*
For each line, split at commas and made a String array of each value, and then
initialized a new Myky (a Myky = one entry), entering in corresponding values for
the parameters.
We tried to anticipate errors with faulty code but we can't fix the problems with
comma splitting.

<this lab involves using tools that are likely to introduce hiccups; log any troubleshooting issues here>
You have to actually download sinbad.jar yourself.
PIAZZA FOR TERMINAL!!!
Problems with bad data (mentioned above)
