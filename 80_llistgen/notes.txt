DISCO:
- When updating our list implementation to allow for generic typing, the best first step is to edit the interface first.
- DLLNode should have been replaced with DLLNode<T> everywhere, even if it appears in the parameters.
- T, or <T> is generally accepted for "type"
- Find and replace is scary, make sure to go through each phrase individually; beware of using replace all

QCC:
- Why does our list implementation work with both DLLNode and DLLNode<T> in the constructor? Is there a difference between the two?
