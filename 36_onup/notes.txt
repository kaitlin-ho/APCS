HW36 - All Quacked Up
2021-11-18
time spent: 1.0

compile time - syntax error
- only first error is reliable; gives guideline (only given when compiler notices an issue)
- indent correctly
- common errors:
    - () / {} / ; / "" / ''
    - assignment types should match
    - arguments in order / obj method invoked should be the right type
- make backup, delete half, run, rinse + repeat


runtime - errors while progam is running
- "hanging" stops and does nothing - infinite loop/recursion
    - loop: print statements before and after loop
        - print statement w/ values of variables in condition and boolean value of condition
    - recursion: stackoverflow
        - check for base case
        - print statement at the beginning of a method for paramaters (to check progress)
- flow of execution - print statments to each method so it can be traced 
    - common error: arguments in the wrong order
- exceptions
    - error msg: name, line, statck trace
    - null pointer - access null variable
    - array index out of bound
    - stackoverflow
    - FileNotFound - make sure the file exists and is in the right path
    - arithmetic exception
- too many outputs; remove print statements and simplify the problem


logic - program does not do what's expected
- hypothesis
    - program is supposed to do something?
    - something that shouldn't be happening?
    - section of code producing unexpected effect? (make sure you know what the methods in Java library does)
- mental model; components of classes/methods
- common errors
    - integer division rounds toward 0
    - float point numbers are approx
    - == is identical, .equals is equivalence
- complex expressions: break into series of assignments and smaller variables (so you can display/check things)
- print (sometimes stored until the code ends) vs println (immediate display)

Stuck? Touch grass

When asking for review
- type of bug
- recent things you did
- error msg

ducky. also reflect on the bug
