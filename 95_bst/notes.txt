HW 95 - Algorithm as Data Structure
2022-05-09
time spent: 1.0 hrs

DISCO:
* The algos for pre-, in- and post-order are almost identical; the only
difference when the root is processed.

QCC:
* The current TreeNode setup means that the tree is unidirectional (like a
singly linked list, as opposed to a doubly linked list).
* Abstraction!!!
* Beware copypasta
* MMMC

With L = level, d = depth, h = height...
1. a perfect binary tree has sum(0, h, 2^L) nodes.
2. at each level, a perfect binary tree has 2^L nodes.
3. height of a complete binary tree w/ n nodes is (log_2)(n)
