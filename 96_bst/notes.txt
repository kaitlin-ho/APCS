HW 96 - BSTs is the Perfect Place for Shade
2022-05-10
time spent: 1.0 hrs

DISCO
* The root node of the BST tree does not add 1, so when calculating height recursively,
  the leaf nodes should return 1 instead of 0.
* Search is very very similar to binary search on a list
* Height and numLeaves also have similar algorithms
